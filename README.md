# APU Hostel Management Fees Payment System (AHMFPS)

The APU Hostel Management Fees Payment System (AHMFPS) is a software solution developed in Java, designed to streamline the management of hostel-related fees for Asia Pacific University's hostel residents. Leveraging Java's object-oriented principles, the system ensures modularity, reusability, and scalability.

The primary objective of this project is to address the challenges faced by hostel management, staff, and residents in handling registration, fee payments, and account updates efficiently. By automating these processes, AHMFPS aims to reduce manual errors, improve record management, and enhance overall user experience.
